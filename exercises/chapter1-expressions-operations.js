//1. Write a for loop that multiples every value in an array and returns the total

//2. Write a function that tests if a parameter is even using the remainder (%) operator

//3. Write a function that returns true if the 1st parameter is greater than or equal to the 2nd paramter AND the 1st paramter is not greater than 5

//4. Write a function that returns false if the 1st parameter is less than or equal to the 2nd paramter OR the 1st paramter is greater than 21

//5. Write a function using a ternary operator that checks if a string's length is longer than 5

//6. Write a function with a while loop that runs as long as y is less than 3 (tip: dont let the loop run forever)

//7. Write a function that iterates through an array of integers and checks if each integer has a remainder.  If there is a remainder add it to a total.  Return the total.
